- 🔭 I’m currently in mandatory military service until Dec. 2024.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning functional programming, music AI and Japanese (JLPT N2).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on something based on C# language or my learning area.

I like to organize a program to solve the inconvenience I have experienced in my daily life. This is why each pinned repositories have differences.  
Therefore, I regard it as the right self-development to gain various development experiences regardless of the field.
